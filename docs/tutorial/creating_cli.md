# Creating a Contact Manager CLI

Moving on from the basics, in this tutorial, we will create a simple CLI application that manages contacts. The application will allow users to add, list, update, and delete contacts.


## Basic Idea
We want a CLI application that stores the contacts in a file on your system and allows you to perform CRUD operations on the contacts. The application will look something like this: 


```bash
$ cm add 
> Enter username: contact_username
> First Name: contact_name
> Last Name: contact_name
> Phone: contact_phone
> Email: contact_email
```

```bash
$ cm get 
> ----- contact_username -----
> First Name:    contact_name
> Last Name:     contact_name
> Phone:         contact_phone
> Email:         contact_email
```

```bash
$ cm update contact_username --last-name new_contact_name
> Contact contact_username updated successfully
```

Now that we know what we want to build, let us start by creating the project structure.

## Project Structure
For this project, we will use the following project structure:

```
examples/
└── src
    └── main
        └── scala
            └── contacts
                ├── app
                ├── cli
                ├── core
                └── domain
```

- `app`: This package will contain the main entry point of the application.
- `cli`: This package will contain the CLI logic such as prompt parsing and command execution.
- `core`: This package will contain the business logic of the application, here is where we will use Catscript!
- `domain`: This package will contain important business logic (mostly types) that `app`, `cli` and `core` will use. 

Let us first start by defining our domain.

## Domain
Our domain will be straightforward, we will have a `Contact` case class that will represent a contact. 

```scala
//src/main/catscript/contacts/domain/contact.scala
type Username    = String
type Name        = String
type PhoneNumber = String
type Email       = String

case class Contact(
  username: Username,
  firstName: Name,
  lastName: Name,
  phoneNumber: PhoneNumber,
  email: Email
)
``` 
The type aliases are great, not only for added readability, but they also provide a way of not accidentally passing the wrong argument to the function. You can also use refined types provided by libraries like [Iron](https://github.com/Iltotore/iron), but for the sake of simplicity, we will use plain strings.

We will also need a function to display the contact in a nice format.

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/domain/contact.scala
case class Contact( ... ):
  def show: String = s"""
    |----- $username -----
    |
    |First Name:    $firstName
    |Last Name:     $lastName
    |Phone:         $phoneNumber
    |Email:         $email
  """.stripMargin
```

We will also define a custom error type that gets thrown when adding an already existing contact.  


```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/domain/contact.scala
case class ContactFound(username: Username) extends NoStackTrace
```

This will make `ContactFound` a subtype of `Throwable` and will allow us to propagate the error in the `IO` monad and handle it whenever we want.

The next step is defining the different commands that our CLI will support.

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/domain/argument.scala
enum CliCommand:
  case AddContact
  case RemoveContact(username: Username)
  case SearchId(username: Username)
  case SearchName(name: Name)
  case SearchEmail(email: Email)
  case SearchNumber(number: PhoneNumber)
  case UpdateContact(username: Username, options: List[Flag])
  case ViewAll
  case Help
```

We will also need a `Flag` type to represent the different options that we can update in a contact.

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/domain/flag.scala
enum Flag:
  case FirstNameFlag(firstName: String)
  case LastNameFlag(lastName: String)
  case PhoneNumberFlag(phoneNumber: String)
  case EmailFlag(email: String)
  case UnknownFlag(flag: String)
```

Now that we have our domain defined, let us move to the core of our application.

## Core business logic
In this section, we will define the core business logic of our application. We will define a `ContactManager` algebra that will contain all the logic to manage contacts:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/core/ContactManager.scala`
trait ContactManager:

  // Save a new contact to the contact list
  def addContact(contact: Contact): IO[Username]

  // Remove a contact from the contact list using the username
  def removeContact(username: Username): IO[Unit]
  
  /**
    * Search for a contact using different things like username,
    * name, email, or phone number. It will return a list with
    * the matching results, or an empty list if none was found.
    *
    * Searching by id should return only one result, se we use
    * an `Option` there.
    */
  def searchId(username: Username): IO[Option[Contact]]
  def searchName(name: Name): IO[List[Contact]]
  def searchEmail(email: Email): IO[List[Contact]]
  def searchNumber(number: PhoneNumber): IO[List[Contact]]

  // Lists all the saved contacts
  def getAll: IO[List[Contact]]

  /**
   * Update a contact using a `modify` function. For example,
   * `updateContact("username")(contact ⇒ contact.copy(firstName = "new name"))`
   */
  def updateContact(username: String)(modify: Contact => Contact): IO[Contact]

end ContactManager
```

Now that we have our algebra defined, let us implement it using Catscript. 

For that, it's common to implement the interface (or in Scala argot, the *algebra*) in the companion object of the trait:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/core/ContactManager.scala
object ContactManager:
  
  def apply(bookPath: Path): ContactManager = new ContactManager:
    override def addContact(contact: Contact): IO[Username] = ???
    override def removeContact(username: Username): IO[Unit] = ???
    override def searchId(username: Username): IO[Option[Contact]] = ???
    override def searchName(name: Name): IO[List[Contact]] = ???
    override def searchEmail(email: Email): IO[List[Contact]] = ??? 
    override def searchNumber(number: PhoneNumber): IO[List[Contact]] = ???
    override def getAll: IO[List[Contact]] = ???
    override def updateContact(
      username: String
    )(modify: Contact => Contact): IO[Contact] = ???
```
As a dependency of the implementation, we will use the path to the file where we will store the contacts. Also, the `apply` function will let us call it using the class name!

The first function will add a contact to the contact list. But first, we need to define a couple of things: 

The fist one will be the encoding of the `Contact` in the file. We’re going to go with a format like this: 

```text
<username>|<firstName>|<lastName>|<phoneNumber>|<email>
```
But of course, you can use any format you want, like JSON, CSV, etc.

Once we defined the encoding, we need a function to parse the file representation to our type in Scala:


```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/core/ContactManager.scala
def apply(bookPath: Path): ContactManager = new ContactManager:
  
    private def parseContact(contact: String): IO[Contact] =
      contact.split('|') match 
        case Array(id, firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, email) =>
          Contact(id, firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, email).pure[IO]
        case _ =>
          new Exception(s"Invalid contact format: $contact")
            .raiseError[IO, Contact]
```

Next, a function to encode the contact to a string:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/core/ContactManager.scala
    private def encodeContact(contact: Contact): String =
      s"${contact.username}|${contact.firstName}|${contact.lastName}|${contact.phoneNumber}|${contact.email}"
```

Finally, a helper function to help us save the contacts in memory:
```scala 3
    private def saveContacts(contacts: List[Contact]): IO[Unit] =
      bookPath.writeLines(contacts.map(encodeContact))
```

Now we will start with the `getAll` function. This is because our contact manager will work by first loading and parsing all the contacts so that we can perform operations on them:

```scala 3
override def getAll: IO[List[Contact]] = 
  for 
    lines    <- bookPath.readLines
    contacts <- lines.traverse(parseContact)
  yield contacts
```

We first load all the contacts in memory using our `readLines` function and then parse them into `Contact`s. We're going to use `traverse` to convert our `List[String]` into a `IO[List[Contact]]`. Why? Because the `parseContacts` function returns an `IO[Contact]`, so it suits perfectly for our use case. 

We can now implement the `addContact` function:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/core/ContactManager.scala
override def addContact(contact: Contact): IO[Username] = 
  for 
    contacts <- getAll                                      // (1)
    _ <- IO(contacts.contains(contact)).ifM( // (2)
      ContactFound(contact.username).raiseError[IO, Unit],
      saveContacts(contact :: contacts)
    )
  yield contact.username 
```

First, we read all of our contacts, line by line using the `ContactManager.getAll` method (1). Then, we check if the contact already exists in the file checking if the username is contained (2). If it does, we raise an error using the `raiseError` method. If it doesn't, we save it to memory using our `saveContacts` methods. This is done with the `ifM`; this method checks for a boolean value in an `IO` and executes one of the two declared effects depending on it.

Now that we have the `addContact` function implemented, we can move to the `removeContact` function:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/core/ContactManager.scala
override def removeContact(username: Username): IO[Unit] =
  for 
    contacts <- getAll
    filteredContacts = contacts.filterNot(_.username === username)
    _ <- saveContacts(filteredContacts)
  yield ()
```

Here we load all the contacts from the file, and then we filter the ones that don't match the username we want to remove. Finally, we write the filtered contacts back to the file.

Now onto the search functionality. The first one is the `searchId` function:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/core/ContactManager.scala
override def searchUsername(username: Username): IO[Option[Contact]] =
  getAll.map(contacts => contacts.find(_.username === username))
```

Again we load all the contacts from the file, and then we find the contact that matches the username we want to search using the `find` functions, it returns an `Option` whenever it found something or not. 

The next three functions are very similar, so we will only show one of them, the `searchName` function:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/core/ContactManager.scala
override def searchName(name: Name): IO[List[Contact]] =
  getAll.map(contacts =>
    contacts.filter(c => c.firstName === name || c.lastName === name)
  )
```

The first part is similar to the previous functions, we load all the contacts from the file, and then we filter the ones that contain the name (or field) we want to search. 


The last function we need to implement is the `updateContact` function. Be aware that this is the most complex function to implement, so we will break it down into smaller parts.

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/core/ContactManager.scala
override def updateContact(
    username: Username
)(modify: Contact => Contact): IO[Contact] = 
  for 
    oldContact <- searchUsername(username) match // (1)
      case None          => ContactNotFound(username).raiseError[IO, Contact]
      case Some(contact) => contact.pure[IO]

    updatedContacts = modify(oldContact) :: contacts.filterNot(_ == oldContact) // (2)
    _ <- saveContacts(updatedContacts)
  yield updatedContact
      
    
```


1. First, we'll find if the Contact we want to modify exists. If it doesn't, we raise a `ContactNotFound` error.

2. In case the contact exists, we are going to apply to it the transform function and add it to the loaded list. While doing that, we delete the old contact via the `filterNot` method.

3. Finally, we save the new contact list to the memory.

Now that we're done with the core of our application, we can move to the CLI part.

## CLI
In this section, we will define our application's command line interface: it will accept commands and print the output to stdout.

It makes little sense to define the behaviour of the CLI in terms of an interface, as there are only a few ways of interacting with the user via a console. That's why we will just wrap these functionalities in some functions in a `Cli` object:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/cli/Cli.scala
object Cli:
  def addCommand ...
```

One way of passing the `ContactManager` dependency to these functions is to pass it as an argument. However, it can be tedious to do this every time we want to use the functionality of our `Cli`, that's why Scala has an option declare implicit parameters via the `given`/`using` clauses. We just need to use the `using` keyword in front of any function's argument and as long as there is a given instance in scope at call site for every `using` clause, that value will be passed automatically. This feature is called [context parameters](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/ca-context-parameters.html).

That said, the first function is going to be the `addCommand`. The idea is to ask the user the contact's information one step at a time and then add it to the contact list:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/cli/Cli.scala
def addCommand(using cm: ContactManager): IO[Unit] =
  for 
    username    <- IO.println("Enter the username: ") >> IO.readLine
    firstName   <- IO.println("Enter the first name: ") >> IO.readLine
    lastName    <- IO.println("Enter the last name: ") >> IO.readLine
    phoneNumber <- IO.println("Enter the phone number: ") >> IO.readLine
    email       <- IO.println("Enter the email: ") >> IO.readLine

    contact = Contact(username, firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, email)
    
    _ <- cm.addContact(contact)
      .flatMap(username => IO.println(s"Contact $username added"))
      .handleErrorWith:
        case ContactFound(username) =>
          IO.println(s"Contact $username already exists")
        case e =>
          IO.println(s"An error occurred: \n${e.printStackTrace()}")

  yield ()
```

The first five `IO.readLine` calls in the `for` comprehension ask for the contact's detail, we then attempt to create the `Contact` object with the information provided calling `addContact` method of the `ContactManager` and handle the errors. If the contact already exists, we print a message to the user, if another error occurs, we print the stack trace of the error to see what went wrong.  

Now the `removeCommand` function:

```scala 3 
//src/main/catscript/contacts/cli/Cli.scala
def removeCommand(username: Username)(using cm: ContactManager): IO[Unit] =
  cm.removeContact(username) >> IO.println(s"Contact $username removed")
```
It simply calls the `removeContact` function and prints a message to the user. The function doesn't check if the contact exists and will delete any matching username anyway, but you can add this logic if you want.

The `searchIdCommand` function is also straight forward, matches the `Options` returned by the `searchId` method and prints the user information if it exists:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/cli/Cli.scala
def searchIdCommand(username: Username)(using cm: ContactManager): IO[Unit] =
  for
    contact <- cm.searchId(username)
    _ <- contact match 
      case Some(c) => IO.println(c.show)
      case None    => IO.println(s"Contact $username not found")
  yield ()
```

All the `searchX` variants are fairly similar so we'll show just one of them:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/cli/Cli.scala
def searchEmailCommand(email: Email)(using cm: ContactManager): IO[Unit] =
  for {
    contacts <- cm.searchEmail(email)
    _        <- contacts.traverse_(c => IO.println(c.show))
} yield ()
``` 

It also uses the `traverse_` method, but with a little variant that optimises it a bit. It takes as a parameter a function from `A => IO[Unit]`, and it will execute the effect for each element of the collection, but it will discard the result of the computation.
`searchEmailCommand` uses the `traverse_` method: a little variant of `traverse` that takes a `A => IO[Unit]` function and then discards the result.
Last but not least, the `updateCommand` function. 

We take as a first parameter the username of the contact we want to update in the database, so we can search for its existence. 

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/cli/Cli.scala
def updateCommand(username: Username, options: List[Flag])(
  using cm: ContactManager
): IO[Unit] =
  cm.updateContact(username): prev =>
    options.foldLeft(prev): (acc, flag) => // (1)
      flag match 
        case FirstNameFlag(name)     => acc.copy(firstName = name) // (2)
        case LastNameFlag(name)      => acc.copy(lastName = name)
        case PhoneNumberFlag(number) => acc.copy(phoneNumber = number)
        case EmailFlag(email)        => acc.copy(email = email)
        case UnknownFlag(_)          => acc
    
  .flatMap(c => IO.println(s"Updated contact ${c.username}")) // (3)
  .handleErrorWith:
    case ContactNotFound(username) =>
      IO.println(s"Contact $username not found")
    case e =>
      IO.println(s"An error occurred: \n${e.printStackTrace()}")
```

This is also quite a bit of code, but let's break it down: 


First, we call the `updateContact` method of the `ContactManager` and pass the function that will modify the contact. To do this, we're going to reduce the list of flags using `foldLeft`. This function takes an initial value (the contact we want to update) and a function describing how to update the initial value (`acc`) with each one of the flags in turn (`flag`) (1). Where, we just use the `copy` methods and pattern match the flags to update the contact (2). After that, we print a message to the user saying that the contact was updated successfully (3). If the contact is not found, we print a message to the user saying that. 

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/cli/Cli.scala
def helpCommand: IO[Unit] =
  IO.println:
    s"""
      |Usage: contacts [command]
      |
      |Commands:
      |  add
      |  remove <username>
      |  search id <username>
      |  search name <name>
      |  search email <email>
      |  search number <number>
      |  list
      |  update <username> [flags]
      |  help
      |
      |Flags (for update command):
      |  --first-name <name>
      |  --last-name <name>
      |  --phone-number <number>
      |  --email <email>
      |
      |""".stripMargin
```

That was tough, congratulations on making it so far! We can now move to the last part of our application.  

## Prompt
The last piece that we need to create is the prompt parsing, that will parse user submitted information into commands that our `Cli` can handle.

We strongly suggest you to use a command line parsing library, like [Decline](https://ben.kirw.in/decline/) but for the sake of simplicity, we'll demonstrate how to create it without the need of an external dependency. 

The first thing we'll do is creating a `parsePrompt` function that will pattern match over the user input and, according to the value will return the appropriate `CliCommand`:  

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/cli/Prompt.scala
def parsePrompt(args: List[String]): CliCommand =
  args match 
    case "add" :: Nil                          => AddContact
    case "remove" :: username :: Nil           => RemoveContact(username)
    case "search" :: "id" :: username :: Nil   => SearchId(username)
    case "search" :: "name" :: name :: Nil     => SearchName(name)
    case "search" :: "email" :: email :: Nil   => SearchEmail(email)
    case "search" :: "number" :: number :: Nil => SearchNumber(number)
    case "list" :: _                           => ViewAll
    case "update" :: username :: options =>
      UpdateContact(username, parseUpdateFlags(options))
    case Nil => Help
    case _   => Help
end parsePrompt
```


We also created a `parseUpdateFlags` function that creates a list of flags that can change the updating behaviour using a similar pattern:  

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/cli/Prompt.scala`
private def parseUpdateFlags(options: List[String]): List[Flag] = 

  @tailrec
  def tailParse(remaining: List[String], acc: List[Flag]): List[Flag] =
    remaining match 
  
      case Nil => acc
  
      case "--first-name" :: firstName :: tail =>
        tailParse(tail, FirstNameFlag(firstName) :: acc)
  
      case "--last-name" :: lastName :: tail =>
        tailParse(tail, LastNameFlag(lastName) :: acc)
  
      case "--phone-number" :: phoneNumber :: tail =>
        tailParse(tail, PhoneNumberFlag(phoneNumber) :: acc)
  
      case "--email" :: email :: tail =>
        tailParse(tail, EmailFlag(email) :: acc)
  
      case flag :: _ => List(UnknownFlag(flag))
    
  
  tailParse(options, Nil)
  
end parseUpdateFlags
```

Because the update flags can be unordered, we case use a recursive function to match each flag and its value and then create a list of `Flag`.

## Main

Now that we have all the required components we can define the entry point of our application.

The first thing that we need to do is create an initial function that that will create our in-memory database (located at `~/.catscript/contacts.data`) if needed:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/app/App.scala
private val getOrCreateBookPath: IO[Path] =
  for
    home <- userHome
    dir  = home / ".catscript"
    path = dir / "contacts.data"
    exists <- path.exists
    _      <- dir.createDirectories.unlessA(exists)
    _      <- path.createFile.unlessA(exists)
  yield path
```


We can then create our `given` instance of `ContactManager`:

```scala 3
getOrCreateBookPath
  .map(ContactManager(_))
  .flatMap: 
    case given ContactManager 
```

With that, our main (`run`) function will be like this:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/app/App.scala
  .flatMap: 
    case given ContactManager =>
      
      Prompt.parsePrompt(args) match 
        case Help                    => Cli.helpCommand
        case AddContact              => Cli.addCommand
        case RemoveContact(username) => Cli.removeCommand(username)
        case SearchId(username)      => Cli.searchUsernameCommand(username)
        case SearchName(name)        => Cli.searchNameCommand(name)
        case SearchEmail(email)      => Cli.searchEmailCommand(email)
        case SearchNumber(number)    => Cli.searchNumberCommand(number)
        case ViewAll                 => Cli.viewAllCommand
        case UpdateContact(username, flags) =>
          Cli.updateCommand(username, flags)
    
    .as(ExitCode.Success)
```

This is what the final code looks like:

```scala 3
//src/main/catscript/contacts/app/App.scala
object App extends IOApp:

  private val getOrCreateBookPath: IO[Path] =
    for
      home <- userHome
      dir  = home / ".catscript"
      path = dir / "contacts.data"
      exists <- path.exists
      _      <- dir.createDirectories.unlessA(exists)
      _      <- path.createFile.unlessA(exists)
    yield path

  def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = getOrCreateBookPath
    .map(ContactManager(_))
    .flatMap:
      case given ContactManager =>
        
        Prompt.parsePrompt(args) match 
          case Help                    => Cli.helpCommand
          case AddContact              => Cli.addCommand
          case RemoveContact(username) => Cli.removeCommand(username)
          case SearchId(username)      => Cli.searchUsernameCommand(username)
          case SearchName(name)        => Cli.searchNameCommand(name)
          case SearchEmail(email)      => Cli.searchEmailCommand(email)
          case SearchNumber(number)    => Cli.searchNumberCommand(number)
          case ViewAll                 => Cli.viewAllCommand
          case UpdateContact(username, flags) =>
            Cli.updateCommand(username, flags)
    
    .as(ExitCode.Success)

```

And that's it!

We’ve created a simple CLI application that manages contacts using Catscript and Cats Effect.
We hope you enjoyed this tutorial and learned a lot about how to use Catscript in a real-world application.

### Exercise
We used a hard-coded path to store our contacts.  

But what if we want to change the path to another location?
Or maybe have multiple locations with different contacts? 

Try to modify the application, so the user can initialise and change the location of a contact book on a specific path and then use that path to store the contacts.

To do that, you can create two new commands, `init` and `change` that will create a new contact book and change the current contact book, respectively.

You can also create new domain representations of that book, like `ContactBook(path: Path, contacts: List[Contacts])` and modify the `ContactManager` to use that representation.  

Good luck!
